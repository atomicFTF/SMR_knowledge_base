## 2.1 Circulation diagram
The BWR single-loop primary coolant system is illustrated in the figure. The steam water mixture first enters steam separators after exiting the core. After subsequent passage through steam dryers located in the upper portion of the reactor vessel , the steam flows directly to
the turbine. The water, which is separated from the steam, flows downward in the periphery of the reactor vessel and mixes with the incoming main feed flow from the turbine. This combined flow stream is pumped into the lower plenum through jet pumps mounted around the inside periphery of the re?ctor vessel. The jet pumps are driven by flow from recirculation pumps located in relatively small-diameter (= 20 inches) external recirculation loops , which draw flow from the plenum just above the jet pump discharge location .

## 2.4 Construction details
The BWRs have three interlocking barriers to contain the products of fission: the cladding, the main circuit casing and a containment building.
The containment building is a smaller structure that includes the tank and the recirculation loop(s). In Normally, the containment atmosphere is "inerted" with nitrogen to prevent explosion if hydrogen is released. The concrete enclosure is closed by a steel cover that must be removed to access the tank and unload the fuel.
The containment is housed in the lower concrete part of the reactor building, the part of which high, in a light structure on steel beams, serves as a handling hall and houses the swimming pool where spent fuel assemblies are stored after core unloading. This pool must also be cooled to evacuate the residual heat from these assemblies.
