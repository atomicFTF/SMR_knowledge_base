## 2.4 Construction details
By July 1942, measurements on these experimental reactors had gone far enough that plans for a critical-size experimental reactor could
to draw up . It was at this time that he had the matrices used to compress the uranium oxides made on Zinn's plans. This decision had serious consequences, since the whole construction of the reactor depended on the shape and
the size of the uranium pieces.
Uranium oxides had to be used, because that there was no sufficiently pure uranium metal. Several factories sought to produce uranium metal, but it was not possible to obtain sufficient quantities until November. The Chicago Pile-1 was a structure built with the following elements of uranium (6 tons of metal and 50 tons of oxide) and graphite (400 tons).
Construction of the Chicago pier began in November. The project grew. They began the machining of graphite blocks, the molding of uranium oxide pellets and they developed measuring devices. Fermi's two construction teams, one led by Zinn and the other
by Anderson, worked almost continuously. V. C. Wilson led the instrumentation work.
The first evaluations of the critical dimensions of the pile were pessimistic. As a precaution, they decided to enclose the pile in a balloon fabric envelope, which could evacuate the air polluted by the fission products.
  The envelope was hung leaving one side open; they placed in the center of the room a first
circular layer of graphite bricks. This layer and the other layers of the stack were surrounded of a wooden frame. Every other layer contained
uranium. By proceeding in this way layer by layer, they build a kind of flattened spheroid, real "pile" of uranium and graphite.
