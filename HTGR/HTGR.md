## 2.2 Main characteristics
HTGR is a nuclear reactor which deploy helium gas for its coolant, ceramic materials, mainly graphite, for its core structure, and able to supply nuclear heat outside. Since light water reactors use metal cladding tube for its fuel and light water for its coolant, the outlet temperature is limited around 300 deg C. Its power generation efficiency is only 30% using steam turbine. On the other hand, HTGR can produce high temperature heat around 1000 deg C using ceramic materials which offer resistance to high temperatures and apply gas turbine system which can achieve high power generation efficiency more than 45%. Its produced heat can also apply to various industry fields

### 2.4.1 Fuel and core, coolant, moderator
a) fuel and core : HTGR have coated fuel particle for its fuel. This paticle has UO2 kernel with fourfold ceramic coating and its diameter is smaller than 1mm. Its coating protects the UO2 kernel and confines fission products generated by nuclear fission. The ceramic coating offers resistance to high temperatures so that it will not failure even at temperature of 1600 deg C.For the core structure of HTGRs, graphite is applied.
b) coolant: there are two types of coolant according to the configuration: Helium and Molten salt. 
  Helium has been the coolant used in most HTGRs to date,  ince helium gas is an inert gas, it can carry heat at high temeprature ranges without any chemical reactions   between the fuel.Additionally, exposing helium to neutron radiation does not make it radioactive, unlike most other possible coolants
  Molten salt:
  

 c) Moderator : The neutron moderator in HTGR reactor is graphite, Graphite has high radiaiton hardness, heat resistance and thermal conduction, and low neutron absorption characteristic so that it has an ablitity to keep its fuel and nuclear chain reaction by moderating fast neutron.
