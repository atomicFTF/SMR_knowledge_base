# 1 Historical reference
The RBMK was the culmination of the Soviet nuclear power program to produce a water-cooled power reactor with dual-use potential based on their graphite-moderated plutonium production military reactors. The first of these, Obninsk AM-1 ("Атом Мирный", Atom Mirny, Russian for "peaceful atom," analogous to the American Atoms for Peace) generated 5 MW of electricity from 30 MW thermal power, and supplied Obninsk from 1954 until 1959. Subsequent prototypes were the AMB-100 reactor and AMB-200 reactor both at Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Station.

By using a minimalist design that used regular (light) water for cooling and graphite for moderation, it was possible to use fuel with a lower enrichment (1.8% enriched uranium instead of considerably more expensive 4% enrichment). This allowed for an extraordinarily large and powerful reactor that could be built rapidly, largely out of parts fabricated on-site instead of by specialized factories. The initial 1000 MWe design also left room for development into yet more powerful reactors. For example, the RBMK reactors at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant in Lithuania were rated at 1500 MWe each, a very large size for the time and even for the early 21st century. For comparison, the EPR has a net electric nameplate capacity of 1600 MW (4500 MWthermal) and is among the most powerful reactor types ever built.

The RBMK-1000's design was finalized in 1968. At that time it was the world's largest nuclear reactor design, surpassing western designs and the VVER (an earlier Soviet PWR reactor design) in power output and physical size, being 20 times larger by volume than contemporary western reactors. Similarly to CANDU reactors it could be produced without the specialized industry required by the large and thick-walled reactor pressure vessels such as those used by VVER reactors, thus increasing the number of factories capable of manufacturing RBMK reactor components. No prototypes of the RBMK were built; it was put directly into mass production.

## 2.2 Main characteristics
As mentioned above, the reactor is quite unique compared to other reactor designs. These design characteristics will be highlighted in this section, showing its distinction from the other reactor types.

2.2.1. Fuel - Slightly enriched uranium pellets are packed into a 3.65 meter long zircaloy tube, forming a fuel rod. 18 of these fuel rods are combined into a cylindrical carriage to form a fuel assembly. Two of these rods are loaded into the pressure tubes. Refueling of the uranium can be done while the reactor is operating since the fuel channels are isolated and can be lifted out of the core safely.

2.2.2. Pressure tubes
With the fuel loaded in these strong metal tubes, these pressure tubes are arranged vertically inside the core of the reactor. Cool light water flows through it which absorbs heat from the fuel assembly. This allows the fuel to cool and causes the light water's temperature to be at 290'C. At this temperature the water is in the form of steam and emerges from the top of the core.

2.2.3. Graphite moderator
This is one of the key distinctions from other reactors. Graphite the same used in pencils, except purer is loaded into the container of the core which is about the size of a small house. Graphite works as the moderator, which means it slows down neutrons in order to sustain a continuous fission chain reaction. A distinction from other reactors is that the moderator here is not cooled down by any coolant. Therefore, the graphite operators at a hot 700'C in contrast, the CANDU reactor's moderator is cooled down to 70'C.

2.2.4. Control rods
The control rods are made of boron carbide, which act to absorb neutrons. This controls the rate of fission in the reactor; the further the control rods are inside the core, the more neutrons they absorb and the slower fission occurs. There are automatic, manual, and emergency control rods which can all be placed into certain depths depending on the conditions inside the core and the goals of operation. The use of control rods in the Chernobyl disaster were a key point for the events that occurred. It was said that "not even the Premier of the Soviet Union is authorized to run with less than 30 rods!", however during the events of the disaster, only about 6 - 8 control rods were inside of the core.

2.2.5. Coolant/steam separator
As mentioned prior, light water is used as the coolant and the working fluid. It acts to keep the fuel relatively cool, and to boil to steam and spin the plant's turbines. It operates in two loops. Each of the two loops has two steam drums (orange circle). This is where the steam from the heated coolant is fed to the turbine to produce electricity in the generator. Each loop has a turbine that it feeds steam to. The steam is then condensed and fed back through as coolant.

2.2.6. Containment
Seen in Figure 3, the containment structure is not as sound as those seen in more modern nuclear power plants. This proved fatal in the Chernobyl accident as the pressure inside of the core blew off the top covering of the core, exposing the radioactive core to the outside world. The containment is made of concrete and metal, that act as a radiation shield.
